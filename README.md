# Papper

An open-source python collection of tools to

* crawl
* parse
* store
* request

open-access scholarly documents.

## arXiv

The initial purpose of this project is to make arXiv more "modern" and offer

* a json API without throttling
* HTML version for articles available under CC licences
* more metadata parsing (most arXiv articles come with their LaTeX source which is way easier to
  parse than PDF documents) e.g. bibliography or forumlas.
